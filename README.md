# progplot

## Timeseries animation

Easy creation of video or gif animated bar charts.
 
## Installation

Download and install can be done through PyPi

```
pip install progplot
```
or

```python
git clone https://github.com/lewis-morris/progplot
cd progplot
pip install -e .
```

You will also need ffmpeg - pretty standard with Linux. Not so sure re windows.

To test if you already have ffmpeg installed:
* Type ffmpeg in your console or command prompt
* You should see details of ffmpeg version etc, if you **do not** you will need to download ffmpeg from their website.
